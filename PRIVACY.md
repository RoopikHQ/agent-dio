# Dio Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 19th, 2026**

Dio respects your privacy and is committed to transparency about how we handle your data. Below is a simple breakdown of where key pieces of data go—and, importantly, where they don’t.

### **Where Your Data Goes (And Where It Doesn’t)**

- **Code & Files**: Dio accesses files on your local machine when needed for AI-assisted features. When you send commands to Dio, relevant files may be transmitted to your chosen AI model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) to generate responses. If you select a cloud model provider, your code is sent directly to that provider. AI providers may store data per their privacy policies.
- **Commands**: Any commands executed through Dio happen on your local environment. However, when you use AI-powered features, the relevant code and context from your commands may be transmitted to your chosen AI model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) to generate responses. We do not have access to or store this data, but AI providers may process it per their privacy policies.
- **Prompts & AI Requests**: When you use AI-powered features, your prompts and relevant project context are sent to your chosen AI model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) to generate responses. We do not store or process this data. These AI providers have their own privacy policies and may store data per their terms of service.
- **API Keys & Credentials**: If you enter an API key (e.g., to connect an AI model), it is stored locally on your device and never sent to us or any third party, except the provider you have chosen.
- **Telemetry (Usage Data)**: Some anonymous usage data may be collected by the IDE or marketplace to help improve services. Dio does **not** collect personally identifiable information, your code, or AI prompts for marketing purposes. You can consult IDE settings to manage telemetry.
- **Marketplace Requests**: When you browse or search for extensions or updates, the IDE makes secure API calls to retrieve listing information. This is handled by the standard marketplace protocols and does not include your code or private prompts.

### **How We Use Your Data (If Collected)**

- We use configuration data only to provide the AI features requested.
- We do **not** sell or share your data.
- We do **not** train any models on your data.

### **Your Choices & Control**

- You can run models locally to prevent data being sent to third-parties.
- You can manage settings to control AI interactions.
- You can remove Dio to stop all data interactions.

### **Security & Updates**

We take reasonable measures to secure your data, but no system is 100% secure. If our privacy policy changes, we will notify you through the extension.
